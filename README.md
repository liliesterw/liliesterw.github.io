### Airbnb Visualization :
# Airbnb Vs. Rent in Melbourne

Airbnb becomes very hype nowadays. They served 191 countries, 81000 cities around the world, with the total listing of more than 6 millions. (iPropertyManagement, 2019) also stated that the Airbnb’s guest arrival increased by 62.5% from the previous year. However, with just looking at the worldwide hype, we cannot justify that those trend are actually happened in Melbourne, since every country has its own situation and condition. 

Based on that, this visualization is being made to give knowledge for both Airbnb’s host and the future Airbnb’s host in Melbourne so that they can get a better view about the current Airbnb market in Melbourne. 

Secondly, by considering that the yearly basis apartment rent price and demand in Melbourne is also high, we want to compare its revenue to the Airbnb’s revenue. After all, we want to see whether listing in Airbnb is a good decision or not.
